Simple schema converter for LabKey

### How to Use

The simple schema converter is a command line tool.

This set of instructions assumes you have `lkschema` as a working command:

1. Open up your command line or terminal.
2. Type `lkschema absolute/path/to/plain-text-schema.txt`
3. The converter will place the new schema as a `.json` file in the same folder as the plain text schema text file.
